# Willmore Surfaces

## Introduction

I did my Mathematics Bachelor Thesis about Willmore Surfaces. I will try to explain the main ideas of the thesis in this post.

First, I will explain what the Willmore functional, \(W\), is. Then, I will visit some of the most important results about Willmore surfaces. Finally, I will explain the main result of my thesis, which is the derivation of the first variation of the Willmore functional, using basic tools of differential geometry in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
