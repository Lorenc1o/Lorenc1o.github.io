# Double Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science

I studied at the University of Murcia, Spain, a double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. It is a 5-years degree, awarding both degrees at the end of the studies. I finished the degree in 2022 and during the studies I developed several course notes and projects, which can be found in my repository dedicated to the [Double Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science](https://github.com/Lorenc1o/Math_Info_UniversityNotes).
