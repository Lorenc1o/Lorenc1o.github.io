Here is a list of some of my projects. For more details, visit the linked pages.

# Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Big Data Management and Analytics (EMJMD BDMA) {#bdma}

I was granted an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree scholarship by the European Commission to study the Big Data Management and Analytics Master's Degree, coordinated by the [Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/). 

The different course notes and projects that I have developed can be found in the dedicated page to the [BDMA notes](https://Lorenc1o.github.io/BDMA_Notes).

# Double Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science {#mathcs}

I studied at the University of Murcia, Spain, a double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. It is a 5-years degree, awarding both degrees at the end of the studies. I finished the degree in 2022 and during the studies I developed several course notes and projects, which can be found in my repository dedicated to the [Double Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science](https://github.com/Lorenc1o/Math_Info_UniversityNotes).
