## Introduction {#introduction}

In this page I will detail what you will find in my repository dedicated to the [Double Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science](https://github.com/Lorenc1o/Math_Info_UniversityNotes). This repository contains all the notes and projects I have developed during my studies at the University of Murcia, Spain, in the double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. It is a 5-years degree, awarding both degrees at the end of the studies. I finished this degree in 2022.

The repository is divided in two main folders. One for the Mathematics courses and another one for the Computer Science courses. Each folder is divided in subfolders, one for each year of the degree. Each year is divided in courses. Each course has a different structure, but in general, it contains the following:
- Lecture notes
- Practical work
- Final project

In addition, there is a folder called TFG in Mathematics and another one in Computer Science. These folders contain the final projects of the degree. Since I did a double degree, I had to do two final projects, one for each degree.

Please, note that all this work was done in Spanish.

## Mathematics courses {#mathematics-courses}

### First year {#first-year}

In the first year of the degree, I did not produce any digital notes nor relevant projects, so I decided not to include this year in the repository. The courses I did in this year were:
- Linear Algebra.
- Real functions of one real variable I and II.
- Euclidean and Affine Geometry.
- Numbers and Sets.
- Topology of metric spaces.

### Second year {#second-year}

Again, I had not yet got used to digital notes, so I did not produce any digital notes nor relevant projects. The courses I did in this year were:
- Functions of several variables I, II and III.
- Advanced Linear Algebra and Geometry.
- Ordinary Differential Equations.
- Introduction to Probability and Statistics.

### Third year {#third-year}

This was the first year I started to develop some digital notes and projects, in part due to the pandemic. The courses I did in this year that are not included in the repository are:
- Linear Optimization.
- Topology of Surfaces.

On the other hand, the courses I did in this year that are included in the repository are:
- Complex Analysis: I wrote the lecture notes of the full course, including all proofs.
- Groups and Rings: I wrote the proofs of all theorems that were asked in the exam. Since it was divided in two parts, the notes are also divided in two parts. In addition, there are the six assignments that were asked during the course. Finally, I solved many of the proposed exercises, which are divided in the chapters of the course.
- Numerical Calculus in one variable: I uploaded all the practical sessions solved, which are different Octave scripts regarding several topics of the course. In addition, I uploaded the two assignments that I submitted.
- Numerical Matrix Analysis: I uploaded the assignments that I submitted as well as a folder with sample code and exercises solved in Octave, which was very useful to prepare the exam.

### Fourth year {#fourth-year}

This year, I produce quite a lot of material, with the only exception of the course of Algebraic Equations, which I did not include in the repository. The courses I did in this year that are included in the repository are:
- Advanced Probability and Stochastic Processes: I wrote the lecture notes of the full course, including all proofs, as well as the proposed exercises.
- Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Analysis: I uploaded my handwritten notes of the course, as well as a summary of the course, which is very dense because we were allowed 10 pages for the exam. In addition, I uploaded most of the proposed exercises.
- Geometry of Curves and Surfaces: I uploaded the assignments that I submitted during the course.
- Global Geometry of Surfaces: I uploaded the assignments that I submitted during the course, together with my handwritten notes of the course and most of the proposed exercises.
- Graph Theory and Discrete Optimization: I uploaded a summary of the whole course, with all proofs and examples, as well as my handwritten notes and the solutions of the proposed exercises.
- Numerical Methods for Differential Equations: I uploaded my handwritten notes of the course, the different assignments asked during the course, the final project and my solution to the practical exam.
- Pobability Theory: I wrote the lecture notes of the full course, including all proofs, as well as the proposed exercises and assignments.

### Fifth year {#fifth-year}

This year I also produced a fair amount of digital material. The only course left out is Commutative Algebra. The courses I did in this year that are included in the repository are:
- Functional Analysis: I wrote the lecture notes of the full course, although I did not include all proofs and some parts are not totally clear (the course was quite dense). In addition, I uploaded the proposed exercises and the assignments that I submitted, as well as solutions to previous exams developed with my classmates.
- Modeling Laboratory: I uploaded both individual and group assignments for both parts of the course: the analysis part and the optimization part.
- Statistical Inference: I wrote the lecture notes of the full course, including all proofs, as well as the proposed exercises and assignments, both for the theoretical part and the practical part.

### TFG in Mathematics {#tfg-in-mathematics}

The final project of the degree in Mathematics is called TFG (Trabajo Fin de Grado). I did my TFG in the field of Differential Geometry, more specifically in the field of Global Geometry of Surfaces. The title of my TFG is "Willmore surfaces in the Euclidean space". I uploaded the final version of the TFG, as well as the slides of the presentation I did, as well as a poster I did for a contest. I also wrote a post in my blog about my TFG, which can be found [here](/blog/en/willmore_surfaces).

## Computer Science courses {#computer-science-courses}

### First year {#first-year-1}

As in the first year of the Mathematics degree, I did not produce any digital notes nor relevant projects, so I decided not to include this year in the repository. The courses I did in this year were:
- Fundamentals of Programming.
- Fundamentals of Computer Architecture I and II.
- Fundamentals of Physics for Computer Science.
- Fundamentals of Logics for Computing.
- Programming Technology.

### Second year {#second-year-1}
This year I already did some interesting projects that are uploaded to the repository. The courses I did in this year that are not included in the repository are:
- Fundamentals of Operating Systems.
- Object Oriented Programming.

On the other hand, the courses I did in this year that are included in the repository are:
- Algorithms and Data Structures I: I uploaded both the individual assignments regarding graphs problems and the group project, which was about implementing a program called 'Quacker' that allowed to manage a social network, and required the usage of different data structures.
- Algorithms and Data Structures II: I uploaded the different projects that were asked during the course, which were about solving different problems using Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms and Backtracking.
- Computer Networks: I wrote a summary of the theoretical part of the course. In addition, I uploaded the weekly assignments that were asked during the course, which were about solving some theoretical exercises, and the final project, which was about implementing a program that allowed to send messages between different computers, the so-called 'NanoChat'.
- Concurrent and Distributed Programming: for this course, I uploaded the final project, which consisted in solving 4 different problems using different parallel programming techniques.

### Fifth year {#fifth-year-1}

For the last year, I produced relevant material for all the courses I did except for computational models. The courses I did in this year that are included in the repository are:
- Machine Learning: I uploaded both the intermediate and final projects, which consisted in a Data Analysis project. The first part was about data exploration, feature engineering and data visualization, while the second part was about implementing different Machine Learning models and comparing them.
